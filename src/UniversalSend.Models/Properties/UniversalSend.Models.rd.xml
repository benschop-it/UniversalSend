    This file contains runtime directives that describe types accessed by your application
    through reflection and other dynamic code patterns. Runtime directives are used to control
    the .NET Native optimizer and ensure it doesn't strip out code your library accesses.
    If your library does not use any reflection, you generally do not need to edit this file.
    However, if your library reflects on types—especially those passed in or derived from types
    passed in—then you should write runtime directives.

    The most common use of reflection in libraries is to discover information about types
    passed into the library. There are three ways runtime directives can express requirements
    for such types:

    1.  Parameter, GenericParameter, TypeParameter, TypeEnumerableParameter
        Use these directives to reflect on types passed as parameters.

    2.  SubTypes
        Use the SubTypes directive to reflect on types derived from other types.

    3.  AttributeImplies
        Use the AttributeImplies directive to indicate that your library needs to reflect on types or methods
        decorated with certain attributes.
