    This file contains runtime directives that specify the types your application 
    accesses via reflection and other dynamic code patterns. Runtime directives 
    are used to control the .NET Native optimizer and ensure it doesn't remove 
    code your library accesses. If your library doesn't use any reflection, 
    you generally don't need to edit this file. However, if your library reflects 
    types — especially those passed into or derived from types in your library — 
    you should write runtime directives.

    The most common way a library uses reflection is to inspect types 
    passed into the library. There are three ways to express such reflection 
    requirements in runtime directives:

    1.  Parameter, GenericParameter, TypeParameter, TypeEnumerableParameter  
        Use these directives to reflect types passed as parameters.

    2.  SubTypes  
        Use SubTypes directives to reflect types derived from other types.

    3.  AttributeImplies  
        Use AttributeImplies directives to indicate your library reflects on 
        types or methods marked with specific attributes.
